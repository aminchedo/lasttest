# Backend Fixes Applied - Production Readiness

## Date: 2025-10-26

## Summary

Applied three critical fixes to unblock production deployment of the ML Training Platform:

---

## 1. ✅ Training Metrics Persistence (DB Adapter Fix)

### Problem
Training runs existed only in memory during execution. The Analytics dashboard had no historical data because metrics weren't being persisted to the database.

### Root Cause
The training simulator was only updating aggregated metrics in the `runs` table, but never inserting step-level metrics into a `training_metrics` table for historical tracking.

### Solution

**File: `server/routes/training.js`**
- Added step-level metric insertion inside the training loop
- Metrics are logged every 10 steps to avoid excessive data
- Inserts to `training_metrics` table with:
  - `run_id`, `step`, `epoch`, `loss`, `val_loss`, `accuracy`, `throughput`, `timestamp`

**File: `server/db.js`**
- Added `training_metrics: []` to the database schema initialization

### Result
- Each training run now creates durable records in `training_metrics`
- Analytics dashboard can reload and display historical training data
- Per-run charts show loss/accuracy trends over time

---

## 2. ✅ HuggingFace Download Validation & SSE Completion

### Problem
- No validation of modelId - users could request arbitrary repos
- No structured SSE events with terminal status
- Frontend stuck at "97% downloading forever" because final "done" event never arrived

### Solution

**File: `server/routes/hfDownload.js` (NEW)**

**Model ID Validation:**
```javascript
// Loads catalog of allowed models from server/catalog/models.json
const modelMeta = ALLOWED_MODELS.find(m => 
  m.id === modelId || m.huggingfaceId === modelId
);

if (!modelMeta) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    ok: false,
    error: 'MODEL_NOT_ALLOWED',
    message: 'Requested model is not in approved catalog.'
  });
}
```

**SSE with Terminal Status:**
```javascript
// Progress endpoint sends structured events:
res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
  modelId,
  status: 'downloading', // or 'done' or 'error'
  progress: percentInt,
  bytesDownloaded,
  totalBytes
})}\n\n`);

// Always sends final terminal status:
// - status: 'done' when completed
// - status: 'error' when failed
// Then closes the stream
```

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/models/download/start` - Validates and starts download
- `GET /api/models/download/progress?modelId=...` - SSE progress stream

### Result
- Only catalog models can be downloaded (security hardening)
- Frontend receives reliable "done"/"error" events
- Cards flip from violet "downloading" to green "ready" reliably

---

## 3. ✅ Asset API Consistency

### Problem
Different endpoints returned different response shapes:
- `/api/catalog/models` returned `[...]` directly
- `/api/datasets` returned `[...]` directly  
- `/api/assets` returned `{ ok: true, data: [...] }`

This broke the Available Resources page ("منابع موجود") which expected uniform shapes.

### Solution

**Standardized all asset endpoints to return:**
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  data: [
    {
      id,
      name,
      kind,        // "model" | "dataset" | "checkpoint"
      size,        // "2.1 GB"
      status,      // "ready" | "downloading" | "error"
      source,      // "HuggingFace" | "local" | "training"
      downloadedAt
    }
  ]
}
```

**Files Updated:**
- `server/routes/catalog.js` - Wrapped models/datasets responses
- `server/routes/datasets.js` - Wrapped dataset list response
- `server/routes/trainingAssets.js` (NEW) - Training outputs/checkpoints

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/training/assets` - Returns training checkpoints in standard format

### Result
- Available Resources page works reliably
- Metrics row (total assets, ready assets, total GB) becomes accurate
- Unified resource view shows models, datasets, and checkpoints together

---

## 4. ✅ Analytics API Enhancement

### Problem
Analytics page had no backend API to load training history or per-run details.

### Solution

**File: `server/routes/analysis.js`**

Added two new endpoints:

**GET /api/analysis/training/jobs**
- Returns list of all training runs
- Includes status, metrics, timestamps
- Format:
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  data: [
    {
      id, runId, jobId, status,
      baseModel, datasets, teacherModel,
      epoch, trainLoss, valLoss, accuracy, throughput,
      bestCheckpoint, lastCheckpoint,
      startedAt, finishedAt, progress
    }
  ]
}
```

**GET /api/analysis/training/status/:runId**
- Returns detailed status for a specific run
- Includes:
  - Current metrics
  - Historical metrics from `training_metrics` table
  - Logs/events for the run
- Format:
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  data: {
    runId, status, progress, metrics,
    history: [...],  // step-by-step metrics
    logs: [...]      // training events
  }
}
```

### Result
- Analytics dropdown lists all training runs
- Selecting a run loads its historical data
- Charts display loss/accuracy trends
- KPI cards show final metrics
- Refresh button works without errors

1. Trigger download for HooshvareLab/bert-fa-base-uncased
2. Watch SSE progress from violet "downloading" to green "ready"
3. Verify final "done" event arrives
4. Check "منابع موجود" shows model as ready

### ✅ Step B: Train a Short Run
1. Start training job (1-2 epochs)
2. Let it complete
3. Check no DB errors in backend logs
4. Verify `training_metrics` table has records

### ✅ Step C: Check Analytics
