# Production Readiness Summary

## Date: 2025-10-26

## ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETED

Six critical backend issues have been fixed to achieve full production readiness.

---

## Issue #1: Training Metrics Not Persisting ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
Training runs existed only in memory. When you stopped training and visited the Analytics page, there was no historical data because metrics weren't being saved to the database.

### The Root Cause
Looking at `server/routes/training.js`, the training simulator only updated the `runs` table with aggregated metrics (final epoch, loss, etc.). There was no code inserting step-level metrics into a `training_metrics` table for historical tracking.

### What Was Fixed

**File: `server/routes/training.js` (line ~367-390)**
```javascript
// Added inside the training loop:
if (step % 10 === 0) {
  await runAsync(
    `INSERT INTO training_metrics (run_id, step, epoch, loss, val_loss, accuracy, throughput, timestamp)
     VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)`,
    [runId, step, epoch + 1, stepLoss.toFixed(3), valLoss.toFixed(3), accuracy.toFixed(3), stepThroughput]
  );
}
```

**File: `server/db.js` (line ~24-36)**
- Added `training_metrics: []` to database schema initialization

### Result
- Each training run now creates durable records in the `training_metrics` table
- Analytics dashboard can reload historical data after training completes
- Per-run charts show loss/accuracy trends over time

### How to Verify
1. Start a training job (let it run 1-2 epochs)
2. Stop the training
3. Go to Analytics page
4. Select that run from dropdown
5. **Expected**: KPI cards show final metrics, chart shows loss progression

---

## Issue #2: HuggingFace Download Validation & SSE ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
- No validation of `modelId` - users could request arbitrary models
- No structured SSE events with terminal status
- Frontend stuck at "97% downloading forever" because final "done" event never arrived

### What Was Fixed

**File: `server/routes/hfDownload.js` (NEW)**

**1. Model ID Validation:**
```javascript
// Loads allowed models from server/catalog/models.json
const modelMeta = ALLOWED_MODELS.find(m => 
  m.id === modelId || m.huggingfaceId === modelId
);

if (!modelMeta) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    ok: false,
    error: 'MODEL_NOT_ALLOWED',
    message: 'Requested model is not in approved catalog.'
  });
}
```

**2. SSE with Terminal Status:**
```javascript
// Always sends structured events:
res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({
  modelId,
  status: 'downloading', // or 'done' or 'error'
  progress: percentInt,
  bytesDownloaded,
  totalBytes
})}\n\n`);

// ALWAYS closes stream after terminal status ('done' or 'error')
```

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/models/download/start` - Validates modelId and starts download
- `GET /api/models/download/progress?modelId=...` - SSE progress stream

**File: `server/index.js`**
- Mounted route: `app.use('/api/models/download', hfDownloadRouter);`

### Result
- Only catalog models can be downloaded (security hardening)
- Frontend receives reliable "done"/"error" events
- Cards flip from violet "downloading" to green "ready" correctly

### How to Verify
1. Trigger download for `HooshvareLab/bert-fa-base-uncased`
2. Watch progress bar go from 0% → 100%
3. **Expected**: Card changes from violet "در حال دانلود" to green "آماده"
4. Go to "منابع موجود" page
5. **Expected**: Model shows up with status "ready"

---

## Issue #3: Multi-Run Training Isolation ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
When multiple training jobs ran in parallel, metrics and logs would leak across runs because the system used single global variables to track training state.

### The Root Cause
The training system used in-memory global variables instead of per-run isolation, causing cross-contamination between concurrent training jobs.

### What Was Fixed

**File: `server/routes/training.js`**
- Converted single global training state to `activeRuns` Map keyed by `runId`
- Each training run now has isolated state tracking
- Added comprehensive logging to `training_logs` table
- Real-time status updates use per-run state

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Single global state
let currentTraining = { ... };

// After: Multi-run isolation
const activeRuns = new Map();
activeRuns.set(runId, {
  status: 'running',
  jobId,
  baseModel,
  datasets,
  currentEpoch,
  lastMetrics: { ... }
});
```

### Result
- Multiple training runs can execute in parallel without interference
- Each run maintains isolated metrics and logs
- Real-time status updates are accurate per run
- Analytics can track multiple concurrent runs

### How to Verify
1. Start two training jobs simultaneously
2. Check Analytics page - both runs should appear separately
3. Verify metrics don't cross-contaminate between runs
4. Check that each run's logs are isolated

---

## Issue #4: SSE Connection Leaks ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections for download progress were not properly closed, leading to memory leaks and hanging connections.

### The Root Cause
Missing connection close handlers and no explicit SSE stream termination on completion or error.

### What Was Fixed

**File: `server/routes/hfDownload.js`**
- Added `req.on('close')` and `res.on('close')` handlers
- Explicit SSE stream termination on terminal states ('done'/'error')
- Proper cleanup of rate limiting maps
- Frontend EventSource cleanup on component unmount

**File: `client/src/pages/Models.jsx`**
- Replaced polling with EventSource for real-time progress
- Added proper EventSource cleanup in useEffect
- Handle 'done' and 'error' terminal states correctly

### Result
- SSE connections close properly on completion
- No memory leaks from hanging connections
- Frontend properly cleans up EventSource on navigation
- Download progress shows accurate real-time updates

### How to Verify
1. Start a model download
2. Watch progress bar reach 100%
3. Verify connection closes automatically
4. Check browser dev tools - no hanging connections

---

## Issue #5: Disk Space Error Handling ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
Large model downloads could fail silently when disk space ran out, leaving partial files and reporting success.

### The Root Cause
No ENOSPC (No Space Left on Device) error handling in download process.

### What Was Fixed

**File: `server/routes/hfDownload.js`**
- Added preflight disk space check before download
- Wrapped file operations in try/catch for ENOSPC
- Emit proper SSE error events on disk full
- Clean up partial files on failure

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Preflight disk space check
const stats = await fs.statfs('/tmp');
if (availableBytes < totalBytes * 1.1) {
  throw new Error('ENOSPC: No space left on device');
}

// ENOSPC error handling
if (error.message.includes('ENOSPC')) {
  errorStatus = 'error';
  errorMessage = 'No space left on device';
}
```

### Result
- Downloads fail gracefully when disk is full
- Users see clear error messages
- No partial/corrupt files left on disk
- SSE streams emit proper error status

### How to Verify
1. Fill up disk space (or simulate with small available space)
2. Try to download a large model
3. Verify error message: "No space left on device"
4. Check that no partial files are created

---

## Issue #6: Download Access Control & Rate Limiting ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
No rate limiting or access control on model downloads, allowing DoS attacks and unlimited concurrent downloads.

### The Root Cause
Missing validation and throttling mechanisms for download requests.

### What Was Fixed

**File: `server/routes/hfDownload.js`**
- Added rate limiting: one active download per IP
- Enforced modelId allowlist validation
- Return 429 status for concurrent download attempts
- Track active downloads per client IP

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Rate limiting per IP
if (activeDownloads.has(clientIP)) {
  return res.status(429).json({
    ok: false,
    error: 'rate_limited',
    message: 'Only one active download allowed at a time'
  });
}

// Model ID validation
if (!modelMeta) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    ok: false,
    error: 'invalid_model',
    message: 'Model ID not permitted'
  });
}
```

### Result
- Only one download per IP address allowed
- Only catalog-approved models can be downloaded
- 429 status code for rate limit violations
- Prevents DoS attacks via download spam

### How to Verify
1. Start a download from one IP
2. Try to start another download from same IP
3. Verify second request returns 429 status
4. Try downloading non-catalog model - should be rejected

---

## Issue #7: Asset API Consistency ✅ FIXED

### The Problem
Different endpoints returned different response shapes:
- `/api/catalog/models` returned `[...]` directly
- `/api/datasets` returned `[...]` directly
- `/api/assets` returned `{ ok: true, data: [...] }`

This broke the "منابع موجود" (Available Resources) page, which expected uniform shapes.

### What Was Fixed

**Standardized all asset endpoints to return:**
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  data: [
    {
      id,
      name,
      kind,        // "model" | "dataset" | "checkpoint"
      size,
      status,      // "ready" | "downloading" | "error"
      source,      // "HuggingFace" | "local" | "training"
      downloadedAt
    }
  ]
}
```

**Files Updated:**
1. `server/routes/catalog.js` - Wrapped models/datasets responses
2. `server/routes/datasets.js` - Wrapped dataset list response
3. `server/routes/trainingAssets.js` (NEW) - Training checkpoints

**New Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/training/assets` - Returns training checkpoints in standard format

### Result
- Available Resources page works reliably
- Metrics row (total assets, ready assets, total GB) becomes accurate
- Unified resource view shows models, datasets, and checkpoints together

### How to Verify
1. Go to "منابع موجود" (Available Resources) page
2. **Expected**: See unified list with:
   - Models from catalog
   - Datasets from catalog
   - Checkpoints from training
3. **Expected**: Metrics cards at top show correct counts

## Bonus Fix: Analytics API Enhancement ✅ ADDED

### What Was Added

**File: `server/routes/analysis.js`**

**New Endpoints:**

**1. GET `/api/analysis/training/jobs`**
- Returns list of all training runs
- Format:
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  data: [
    {
      id, runId, jobId, status,
      baseModel, datasets, teacherModel,
      epoch, trainLoss, valLoss, accuracy, throughput,
      bestCheckpoint, lastCheckpoint,
      startedAt, finishedAt, progress
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. GET `/api/analysis/training/status/:runId`**
- Returns detailed status for a specific run
- Includes:
  - Current metrics
  - Historical metrics from `training_metrics` table
  - Logs/events
- Format:
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  data: {
    runId, status, progress, metrics,
    history: [...],  // step-by-step metrics
    logs: [...]      // training events
  }
}
```

### Result
- Analytics dropdown lists all training runs
- Selecting a run loads its historical data
- Charts display loss/accuracy trends
- KPI cards show final metrics
- Refresh button works without errors

### How to Verify
1. Go to Analytics page
2. Open "مدل / اجرا" dropdown
3. **Expected**: See all past training runs
4. Select a completed run
5. **Expected**:
   - KPI cards show final accuracy, val loss, throughput, status
   - "روند پیشرفت مدل" chart shows loss curve
   - "رخدادها و هشدارها" panel shows events
